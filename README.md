# TFG: Medical Device to assist Hemiplejic Patients in Neuro-rehab

The project concludes with a prototype of a medical device capable of stimulating the paralyzed limbs with the aid of recording biosignals from the own user (using healthy limbs)

To summarize the mission, this device will "imitate" the skeletal musle like a "mirror", so the paralized limbs can be stimulates by the patient, indirectly, by stimulating naturrally his healthy limb.

-Features:
Control Software developed in Python 3.7 with the integration of OpenSignals SW. While the OpenSignals Software is used for recording and visualizating the EMG signal, and the SW developed is in charge of coordinating the EMG device and the FES device to work in real-time. This SW developed includes a GUI to start and control the process of the stimulation.

Hardware:
EMG: Bioplux (OpenSignals)
FES:TremUna (UNA Systems)
